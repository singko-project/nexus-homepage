  <h2>MEMBERSHIP</h2>
  <p><strong>1. Membership Includes</strong><br>
  As a member of <strong>Nexus</strong>, you gain access to a vibrant all-in-one community where you can:<br>
  • Buy, sell, or promote products and services.<br>

  <strong>2. Membership Validity</strong><br>

  <h2>FREE RAFFLE</h2>

  • Each new member you bring in grants 1 additional bonus raffle entry. The more you share, the better your chances of winning — ensuring everyone has a fair and rewarding opportunity.<br><br>
  <strong>Fair and Transparent Draw</strong><br>
  • The draw begins once the <strong>Promo End Timer reaches 100%</strong>.<br>
  • Raffle winners are selected randomly using our advanced <strong>Raffle Number Generator</strong>. The process is <strong>transparent, unbiased, and designed to make every draw exciting</strong>.<br>
  • To keep yourself updated on whether the draw has started, please visit the <strong>Promo End Timer</strong>. You can also <strong>view your unique initial raffle number, bonus raffle entries, and referral code</strong>, and check the <strong>Raffle Winners</strong> inside the <strong>Account Lookup page</strong>.</p>

  <h2>REFERRAL PROGRAM</h2>
  <p>The Referral Program is designed to reward members for helping grow the Nexus community. By inviting others to join, you not only contribute to a thriving, engaging platform but also enjoy extra benefits for yourself.<br><br>
  <strong>Additional Bonus Raffle Entries</strong><br>
  For every successful referral you bring into Nexus, you receive <strong>1 extra raffle entry</strong> for the Free Raffle.<br>
  •	These entries are <strong>added automatically</strong> to your account once the referral joins and is verified.<br>
  •	There is <strong>no limit</strong> to how many bonus entries you can earn — the more people you refer, the higher your chances of winning in the Free Raffle.<br>
  •	Bonus entries <strong>stack on top of your initial raffle entry</strong>, giving you an advantage without any additional cost.<br>
  •	This system ensures that all members have a <strong>fair and transparent opportunity</strong> to win, while also encouraging growth and engagement within the community.<br><br>
  <strong>Referral Bonus</strong><br>
  As part of the Referral Program, each successful member you bring into Nexus earns you a <strong>₱100 referral bonus</strong><br>.
  •	The Referral bonus is <strong>automatically processed</strong> once the system detects your referral and will be <strong>sent directly to your e-wallet</strong>.<br>
  •	There is <strong>no limit</strong> to how many referral bonuses you can earn — the more members you invite, the more rewards you accumulate.<br>
  •	Referral bonuses are <strong>separate from bonus raffle entries</strong>, giving you both <strong>monetary rewards</strong> and <strong>higher chances of winning</strong> in the Free Raffle.</p>

  <h2>MEMBER TOOLS<h2>
  <p><strong>ACCOUNT LOOKUP PAGE</strong><br>
  Easy access to check your account, including your referral code, initial raffle entry, and updates on total invites, referral bonuses earned, and bonus raffle entries.<br><br>
  <strong>Promo End Timer</strong><br>
  The progress bar acts as a timer. It gradually fills up, and once it reaches 100%, the promo officially ends — including the registration and referral program. When the promo closes, the raffle draw will automatically begin.<br><br>

  <h2>PAYOUT</h2>
  <p>• Raffle Prizes: Processing will begin on the same day after the draw is completed.<br>
  • Referral Bonuses: Due to high volumes, processing may take 24 to 72 hours.<br>
  • For the Jackpot and Mega prize winners, we will reach out to ensure they can claim their prize properly, as e-wallet providers set limits based on each participant’s account status.<br>
  • Transfer fees may apply for non-Maya accounts for both Raffle Prizes and Referral Bonuses.</p>
